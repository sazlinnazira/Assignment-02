     My name is Sazlin Nazira binti Che Sulaiman. I am 21 years old and I come from Pasir Puteh, Kelantan. I am currently a student at Universiti Malaysia Perlis (UniMAP). Before pursuing my studies at the university level, I completed my STPM education at SMK Bukit Jawa.

     Throughout my life and educational journey, I have gone through various experiences that have shaped me into a more mature and independent person. During my STPM studies, I faced many challenges, especially in time management, academic pressure, and the need to stay focused and consistent. Although it was not easy, I learned not to give up easily and to always find inner strength to move forward. These experiences taught me the true meaning of patience and perseverance.

     Now, as a university student at UniMAP, I am learning to adapt to a new environment that is very different from my life back home. I have learned to be more independent, to manage my time between assignments and personal life, and to improve my communication and social skills. Living away from my family has also taught me to appreciate them more, especially my mother and father who are my source of strength and inspiration in every step I take.

     Every experience, whether sweet or bitter, has given me meaningful lessons. I believe that every challenge I face today is a stepping stone to future success. With passion, prayers, continuous support from my family, and consistent effort, I am determined to achieve my goals and become a successful person who will make my family proud.
